    <h1>Homework 5 - Arrays</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="HW5part1.html">Part 1</a>
            <p>This assignment requires the creation of a user-friendly web page with an interactive form. The form should prompt users to enter their name, select their age group via radio buttons, check off which web browsers they've used, and choose their favorite movie genre from a drop-down list. It must also include a submission and a reset button. The accompanying script must validate that all sections of the form have been completed before submission; if not, it should display an error message without resetting the entire form. Upon successful validation, a confirmation message will appear. The assignment emphasizes the importance of a good user experience by preventing data loss due to single-field errors.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <a href="HW5part2.html">Part 2</a>
            <p>The task is to create a web page featuring two dropdown menus that navigate to different URLs. The first menu should automatically redirect upon selection using an onchange event, while the second requires a button click, leveraging an onclick event, to initiate navigation. Each menu will offer a minimum of three website choices. The critical aspect of the assignment is to ensure that the selected websites from either menu open in a new tab or window, providing a seamless user experience.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="HW5part3.html">Part 3</a>
            <p>In this assignment, you'll build a web page that allows users to retrieve information from a pre-existing dataset based on July 2019 census data. The interface will include a form where users can input a U.S. state's full name or abbreviation, submit this information, or reset the form. Results will be displayed in a designated output area on the page. Your script should validate user input against the dataset, insensitive to case differences, and either return the corresponding state data in a user-friendly format or provide a clear error message if the state is not found. The aim is to create an intuitive and error-tolerant user experience that avoids user frustration by providing clear guidance and retaining valid input even when part of the submission is incorrect.</p>
