            <a href="HW5part1.html">Part 1</a>
            <p>This assignment requires the creation of a user-friendly web page with an interactive form. The form should prompt users to enter their name, select their age group via radio buttons, check off which web browsers they've used, and choose their favorite movie genre from a drop-down list. It must also include a submission and a reset button. The accompanying script must validate that all sections of the form have been completed before submission; if not, it should display an error message without resetting the entire form. Upon successful validation, a confirmation message will appear. The assignment emphasizes the importance of a good user experience by preventing data loss due to single-field errors.</p>

            <a href="HW5part2.html">Part 2</a>
            <p>Developed a webpage to educate clients about compound interest. Upon loading, the page displayed a header followed by three tables illustrating compound interest calculations over five years for different interest rates. Emphasis was placed on efficient coding, using nested loops for table creation, and enhancing aesthetics through alternating row colors with jQuery or CSS.</p>
