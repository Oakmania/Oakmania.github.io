The main page serves as a landing hub, featuring hyperlinks to Part 1 and Part 2, as well as a link to return to the Homework 1 main page. In Part 1, we created a webpage that utilizes JavaScript to display styled text. Part 2 involves creating a webpage with a form that accepts three integers from the user; upon submission, various calculations are performed and displayed.</td>

					<td>Requires students to develop a web-based application comprising two main parts. In Part 1, we design a form to calculate and display student grades based on validated input values, integrating functionalities for error messages and grade calculations. Part 2 involves creating a webpage to compute salesperson earnings based on commission, requiring user input validation and accurate calculations. The assignment aims to enhance our skills in JavaScript, focusing on functions, data validation, and dynamic webpage content updating, without the use of alert boxes for error messages.</td>

					<td>Students were tasked with designing two web pages. In the first webpage, using both 'for' and 'while' loops, we computed the sum and product of specific integer sequences, making sure large numbers were readable with toLocaleString(). In Part 2, we emphasized our understanding of compound interest by presenting three auto-generated tables that showcased five-year interest calculations for 5%, 6%, and 7% rates on a $1000 principal. We used nested loops for efficient construction and added aesthetic touches via jQuery or CSS.</td>

Avoid using alert boxes for feedback, opting for integrated display messages instead.</td>

					<td>Comprehensive web development assignment that include three parts. Part 1 involves creating a form for users to input a decimal number and then displaying various rounded values of this number. Part 2 focuses on developing a text analysis tool where users can input a long text and a single character, with the script counting and displaying the frequency of that character in the text. Part 3 requires building a webpage that allows users to input a phone number in a specific format and then displays its separated components (area code, first 3 digits, last 4 digits). Each part emphasizes creating a responsive, modern-looking interface with appropriate input validation and dynamic content generation, showcasing the integration of various web technologies.</td>

					<td>This assignment requires student to focus on two distinct parts. In Part 1, the task involves creating an interactive webpage where users can dynamically adjust the styles of a text area, including background color, text formatting (bold, italic, underline), and font size. This part emphasizes real-time interaction using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Part 2 advances into the realm of user personalization by utilizing cookies. It requires the creation of a webpage that saves and retrieves user-specific data (name and username) using cookies. When a user revisits the page, they are greeted with a personalized welcome message, demonstrating basic cookie handling techniques. Together, these parts aim to provide hands-on experience with dynamic styling and user data management in web development.</td>
